# Food_Delivery_Website
In this project, I developed a comprehensive food delivery website using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The platform is designed to offer a seamless and user-friendly experience for both customers and administrators, enabling smooth food ordering and delivery.

Key features of the website include user authentication and a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. The frontend, built with React, ensures a dynamic and interactive user interface, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, manages server-side logic and API integration. MongoDB serves as the database, efficiently handling user accounts, order information, and menu details.

Step 1: Run Backend first and then frontend 

1.1 : Command at backend after putting the path of project in VSterminal: "cd Backend-obfuscated"

1.2 : "npm start"

Step 2: Run frontend , enter the path of ur project destination in split terminal and follow steps

2.2 : "npm start"

NOTE:   
Put up your data and values in the "config" file. It includes data of stripe, mailtrap, and localhost url and many such details.
